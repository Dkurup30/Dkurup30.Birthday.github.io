        Happy Birthday, Apoorva!!!!  

        Wow, you've made it through so many steps of growing up, and now you're hitting that last big one of being a teenager. What a ride itâ€™s been, right? But look at you nowâ€”a cooler, stronger version of yourself, and you just keep getting better.

        As you tackle this final hurdle, Iâ€™m wishing you nothing but the bestâ€”warmest hugs, the longest smiles, and the kind of laughter that makes your belly ache. Lifeâ€™s going to throw some more tears your way (because thatâ€™s just how it is), but remember, those tears mean youâ€™re alive, and thereâ€™s always a rainbow after the rain.

        Hereâ€™s to this new year treating you like the best kind of friend. Happy Birthday again!! <br>

        <span class="signature">Love, Harry x</span>

        Wishing You The Happiest Birthday, Apoorva!! 

        May this new year of life reward you with the best moments in your life yet, and you are constantly surrounded by love and people who bring you happiness. And even though life might want to bring you down at points, just remember, you'll fight them & win over like you always do!!

        May the sweetest melodies of music & life always keep you joyous and hopeful despite it all!! <br>
